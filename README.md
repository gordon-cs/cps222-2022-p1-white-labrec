    2. Compare given test1 out file with one generated by program 
        Use diff command
        Ex. ./project1 < test1.in > test1-output1
            diff test-output1 test1.out
    3. Check that boards produced are the same
With Created Tests:
    1. Copy number of organisms, locations, and number of generations
        From .in files
        Ex. ./project1 < glidergun.in
    2. Run program
    3. Observe if correct pattern appears
